# DustPress Starter Theme

A basic and very bare theme that you can build your own theme from. There isn't really any layout or content but file structure and examples of classes to start with.

## Install

The theme itself would be installed just like any other. Download the contents of this repository to your wp-content/themes directory.

Add DustPress in the mix by requiring it via `composer` and using Composer's autoloading feature or simply clone its [repository](https://github.com/devgeniem/dustpress) to your preferred destination and require the `dustpress.php` file in the beginning of the `functions.php` of the theme.

Then just activate the theme from the WordPress admin panel, and you are good to go!

## How to continue?

Further instructions on how to develop with DustPress can be found at the [readme file](https://github.com/devgeniem/dustpress/blob/master/README.md) of the main project.
